        <p>Hi, my name is Gabriel, and I'm an aspiring FullStack Developer from Romania.</p>
        <p>I love to learn new stuff, and in my search for the best learning material I end up on a lot of premium courses landing pages.</p>
        <p>Most of these courses have fair prices, but usually the pricing is tailored for people in more affluent countries from North America, Western & Northen Europe and a few other countries scattered accross the globe.</p>
        <p>My country is anything but affluent, so the financial strain to educate myself by using the best resources on the web is quit big.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the makers & businesses you will find on this website, me and other curious minds from around the world benefit from location-based discounts, that make it more affordable for us to learn and create stuff.</p>
        <p>If this website has helped you, and you would like to support me to make more websites like this, you do that by <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nechita">buying me a coffee</a>.</p>
