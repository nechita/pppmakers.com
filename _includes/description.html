    <p><strong>What is PPPMakers?</strong><br>PPPMakers will showcase courses or products which are discounted based on the customer’s <strong>Purchasing Power Parity</strong>. It’s quite often that people interested in learning or developing their skills live in a country which might not be a great <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global purchasing power</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Why would I discount my course based on PPP?</strong><br>People who can’t afford to pay for courses will end up getting a copy by other means...which is a loss for both parties: makers or creators lose sales as their product is leaked and distributed online, and customers as well. Course makers might get discouraged and stop publishing new content as their business might be unprofitable.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I get my course featured?</strong><br>Looking to have your course/product featured on PPP Makers? Drop us a tweet/DM on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NechitaGabriel" title="My Twitter">(@NechitaGabriel)</a> with your course along with a brief description and we'll get back to you asap.</p>
