    <p><strong>What is PPPMakers?</strong><br>We'll feature courses or products discounted based on the customer’s <strong>Purchasing Power Parity</strong>. Part of your audience might live in a country which isn't a great <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global purchasing power</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Why would I discount my courses?</strong><br>People who can’t afford to pay for courses will end up getting a copy by other means...which is a loss for everyone involved. As such, we're trying to help course makers  expand their customer base by adopting a new pricing strategy.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I get my course featured?</strong><br>Looking to have your course featured on PPPMakers? Drop us a tweet/DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/NechitaGabriel" title="My Twitter">(@NechitaGabriel)</a> with your course and a brief description and we'll get back to you asap.</p>
