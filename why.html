        <p>You are probably wondering, why whould you give out discounts to people based on their location?</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It's a legitimate question, so I got a few possible reasons for which you might make this an important part of your <em>pricing</em> strategy. But before that, let me make you understand what it's like to live in a country with a poor global purchasing power.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I love to learn new stuff, and in my search for the best learning material I end up on a lot of premium courses landing pages.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Most of these courses have fair prices, but usually the pricing is tailored for people in more affluent countries like North America, Western & Northen Europe and a few other countries scattered accross the globe.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My country is anything but affluent, so the financial strain to educate myself by using the best resources on the web is quit big.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Thanks to the makers & businesses you will find on this website, me and other curious minds from around the world benefit from location-based discounts, that make it more affordable for us to learn and create stuff.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For me, these discounts are the difference between buying something or not, so for you a 50% discount off the full price for someone located in Easter Europe, might mean the difference between making $0 or 50% on a sale. If you sell something that has low hosting costs or is easy to "duplicate the product", your bottom line will not suffer, it might actually grow as a consequence of creating a more inclusive pricing strategy.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>A few good reasons why you would want to integrate PPP in your pricing strategy:</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>1. You will get rid off sob stories from people asking for a discount.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2. You will earn new clients that you might scare away with your pricing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>3. You signal to your audience that you understand and you care for the fact that not all people can afford your courses.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>4. Free advertising from websites like this one :).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>5. Free advertising from excited new customers tweeting about the fact that you have adapted pricing based on PPP :).</p>
